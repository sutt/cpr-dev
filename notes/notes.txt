CellPullRequest:

	
Overview / Main Points
------------------------

	
	- need a way to merge only certain cells, otherwise all the progress is overwritten
	
		- unless, we can create a merge strategy which does UNION on exisiting work and new additions
		
	- idea: create a "cool" guid in the cell where you want to receive the teachers-pr. This can be function in CPR-module. Once you have that unique string, in the notebook, merge can navigate and find it. e.g.:
	
		---------------
		In[ ] cpr.public_code(2)
		---------------
		Out[ ] awesome-aardvark-2345
		----------------
		In [ ] 
		----------------
		
			-> now we'll try to merge just below awesome-aardvark-2345 on the students notebook
			
	- Stages of Dev:
		1.) teacher able to push out code to students
		2.) students are able to deliver teacher their code
		
		- nice to haves:
			- most projects will involve a datasets so that will need to be included in the 
			- each student can have one main repo where teacher can sync with students progress
		
Todo:
-------------------------

	12.14
	
	[ ] setup the master git repo for the project
	
	[ ] setup the local git-server
	
	[ ] setup a testing framework 
	
	[ ] setup the module for cpr class
	
	[ ] create some examples of merge conflicts
	
	[ ] how to do git merge without git-pull?
	
	
	12.12
	
	[x] set up a dummy remote repo
	[x] open up two terminals, two notebooks, two local repos
	
	[x] understand the delay in RELOAD for notebook
		-> refreshing the page seems to work
	
	[ ] how well do changes to meta-data within a cell work to merge?
		[x] demonstrate some meta-data changing -> need to save from notebook
	
	[x] build a script for add, commit push
	[ ] build a script to add, commit, pull
	
	[ ] try a git checkout -- book1.ipynb while live
	
	[ ] setup an offline working copy
		>git clone --local ../remote/example-repo
		>cd example-repo
		>git status
		>git remote get-url origin
			/mnt/c/Users/wsutt/Desktop/cpr/misc/../remote/example-repo/
	
	[x] surface some client issues by changing students notebook before the pull
	
	[x] can i run an .sh file in windows terminal?
		->yes, but it shells out and closes too quickly to read
		[x] perhaps it can work for git? -> yes
		
	[ ] do i have any extensions installed in base?
		


Detailed Notes:
-----------------------------
		
		+ even without any actual changes to students, `git diff --stat` returns this...
			"""
			 warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in book1.ipynb.
			 The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
			"""
			
			- but trying to commit that fails:			
				"""
				nothing to commit, working tree clean
				"""
		
		+ merging fails when student+teacher both make changes, and student's chnages are not committed.
		
				error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
					book1.ipynb
				Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
				Aborting
				Updating 05085cf..e81cbeb
		
			also:
			
				Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
				
				? what is "fast-forwarding" ?
				
		+ Looks like student's branch get's stuck behind teacher's once he starts merging.
		
			"""
			Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 3 commits.
